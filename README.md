# üçÖ Tomato Disease Classification Using Transfer Learning

## Project Overview

This project classifies various tomato diseases, including bacterial spot, early blight, and late blight, using a CNN model with transfer learning. By leveraging a pre-trained VGG16 model, we aim for high accuracy with lower computational requirements, enabling early disease detection and aiding farmers in crop protection.

## Key Steps

* **Data Loading**: Loaded tomato leaf images
* **Data Preprocessing**: Resized and normalized images for the model
* **Transfer Learning Model**: Adapted VGG16 for tomato disease classification
* **Model Training**: Trained on the labeled dataset
* **Evaluation**: Assessed model accuracy
* **Results and Conclusions**: Summarized model performance and potential use cases

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning for plant disease detection. By utilizing VGG16, the model quickly adapts to identify tomato diseases with high accuracy, making it a valuable tool for precision agriculture.
